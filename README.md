## Discourse RStudio Composer Template

This plugin is designed to work with two other plugins:

- [RStudio RSS Polling](https://github.com/paviliondev/rstudio-rss-polling)
- [New Topic Form Plugin](https://github.com/paviliondev/discourse-new-topic-form)

The primary use case for this plugin is in the presentation of RStudio RSS feeds. Unless otherwise noted, the references to the "composer template" are to the RStudio RSS Composer template.
